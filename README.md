# 9.13 Wot gun sounds for wot 1.26+
 Mod that changes gun sounds for the older versions from 0.9.13. This mod is based on KptKosmiT91's mod. It is probably not perfect, but until KptKosmiT91 has time to update his mod on wgmods, this could do the job

In case anyone wants to create its own version, or update it to newer versions if it stops working and I have not updated it, the source code of this repository contains the full WWise project with all the changes needed to generate the SoundBank for this mod. The audio_mods.xml is included in the latest release 9.3GunSounds<>.zip

Installation:

Drop the audioww folder inside the res_mods/"latest game version"/

The latest game version will be the latest folder, if sorted by name, where there is a readme.txt. This is important, because some other mods, like tomato.gg, will create more folders for predictible future versions so it can update itself.
Another consideration is that the latest game version may not match the one specified in the mod, but if I have not updated it, it probably still works.
