# 9.13 Wot gun sounds for wot 1.26+
 Mod that changes gun sounds for the older versions from 0.9.13. This mod is based on KptKosmiT91's mod. It is probably not perfect, but until KptKosmiT91 has time to update his mod on wgmods, this could do the job

In case anyone wants to create its own version, or update it to newer versions if it stops working and I have not updated it, the source code of this repository contains the full WWise project with all the changes needed to generate the SoundBank for this mod. The audio_mods.xml is included in the latest release 9.3GunSounds<>.zip
